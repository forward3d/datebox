Changes to Relative
Change behaviour of last_n_days to return non-inclusive period of n days before provided
last_n_days :exclusive parameter is gone, :inclusive parameter replaces it. Returned result is not inclusive by default.
Introduced last_day for consistency (same as day_before)

0.4.3
Changed behaviour of last_week to be more consistent with other last_ methods particularly on Sunday

0.2.0
Changed Datebox::Relative methods from instance methods to class methods. This requires changes in code.
